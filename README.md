# Supply Chain Optimization – Capstone Project

## Overview
Capstone project focused on optimizing supply allocation across warehouses using machine learning to reduce imbalances and improve operational efficiency.

## Objective
Build a predictive model to determine the best-fit supply distribution and support data-driven supply chain decisions.

## Data
Operational and demand-related data covering warehouse supply, distribution patterns, and shipment imbalances.

## Approach
- Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis  
- Evaluated multiple regression models  
- Selected Random Forest Regression based on performance comparison  

## Tools & Skills
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, EDA, Machine Learning.

## Key Outcomes
- Identified Random Forest as the best-performing model  
- Improved accuracy in supply allocation  
- Enabled optimized resource utilization and reduced distribution imbalance
